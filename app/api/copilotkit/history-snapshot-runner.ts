// The server half of a tutor's "resume on reload" (docs/chat.md → Resuming a
// conversation): an `AgentRunner` decorator that answers the chat's `connect`
// with the thread's STORED messages, so a reloaded tab sees its conversation
// again. It sits INNERMOST, directly around the `InMemoryAgentRunner`, so the
// reasoning stripper and the failure reporter see its frames like any other.
//
// Why a snapshot from the database: the in-memory runner only remembers runs of
// THIS process (LRU-bounded, lost on restart), and the browser wipes its message
// list on the first connect of a thread anyway. So the connect is answered with
//
//   RUN_STARTED{runId:"restore-<uuid>"} · MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT · RUN_FINISHED
//
// — the client verifier wants run framing around anything it applies — followed
// by the inner connect FILTERED: the in-process replay re-emits the very same
// messages (same ids: user messages keep their client-minted id in
// `mastra_messages`, an assistant reply streams under its stored id, or
// `<id>-agui-text` for text after a tool call), and the client APPENDS a replayed
// TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT to an existing message rather than replacing it. So every
// text/reasoning event of a stored id is dropped, and every tool call whose parent
// is a stored message is dropped with its args/end/result. Reasoning is never
// stored, so a FINISHED run's reasoning is dropped too (it would otherwise land as
// a stray block below the restored conversation; only teachers receive reasoning
// at all). What remains is bare run framing (harmless), a run whose save failed
// (shown, as a bonus), and a run still in flight, whose reply is not stored yet
// (a reload mid-answer), reasoning included.
//
// A HISTORIC `RUN_ERROR` (a failed run the in-memory store replays) would end
// the stream for the verifier — nothing may follow a RUN_ERROR — so it becomes a
// RUN_FINISHED of that same run. A LIVE one (the in-flight run failing) passes.
// Historic vs live: `InMemoryAgentRunner.connect` pushes its whole history into a
// ReplaySubject before returning, so everything that arrives DURING the subscribe
// call is history and everything later is live — pinned by the unit test.
//
// The connect is already token-verified (`x-thread-token` over the code, the
// session user and this thread) before it reaches any runner. The resume rule
// (lib/tutor-history-gate.ts) then applies the SAME rules as the actions: the
// resume action's idle limit (plus a grace for the action → connect gap), or —
// past it — a history-enabled code with the session user's ownership row, as
// `openTutorThread` requires. So a hand-crafted client holding an old token gets
// no more from `connect` than the actions would allow.
// Anything else — a refused rule, an empty thread, a database error — falls back
// to the plain inner connect: the behaviour without this runner, never a RUN_ERROR.
//
// FRAGILE ACROSS UPGRADES, like the other two decorators: it delegates the four
// abstract `AgentRunner` methods one by one (guarded in
// reasoning-runner.unit.test.ts), and it relies on undocumented behaviour of
// CopilotKit / AG-UI / Mastra (the connect wipe, the verifier's rules, the replay
// shape, the id alignment). CI guards that with the reload round-trip
// (e2e/tutor-reload-roundtrip.spec.ts); also run `npm run test:e2e:live-llm`
// locally before bumping any of them (docs/chat.md).
