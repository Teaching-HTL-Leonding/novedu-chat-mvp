// The ONE route that serves app-hosted image bytes: same-origin and
// COOKIE-SESSION authenticated, `<id>` being the immutable `novedu_images`
// version row id. A browser `<img>` sends the session cookie by itself, which
// is why no signature, query token or expiry exists here.
//
// It sits behind the default proxy.ts cookie gate with NO matcher exemption,
// and the handler still calls `getSession()` itself — the gate is a redirect
// convenience, this check is the access control.
//
// The policy, verbatim from the design: teacher-hosted images are SHARED
// AUTHENTICATED ASSETS, not private per-teacher, per-user or per-code
// resources. Any signed-in Novedu user who possesses an active row URL may read
// it, including after the activity code that displayed it expires; the URL
// alone is insufficient without a valid session. This route therefore runs NO
// `checkCode()`, verifies NO thread token, and writes NO user↔code link — the
// quiz page still runs `checkCode()` before it ever hands out a URL.
//
// The active row is re-read on EVERY request, a conditional one included, so a
// deleted or replaced image stops being served immediately; a replacement gets
// a new row id, so the old URL stays dead. `Cache-Control: private, no-cache`
// plus a strong `ETag` over the immutable row id lets a browser keep a private
// copy it must revalidate, and no shared cache may store it.
//
// SVG renders only through `<img src>`: `nosniff` plus a sandboxing CSP on
// EVERY response means direct navigation to an SVG cannot execute in the
// application document (docs/images.md).
