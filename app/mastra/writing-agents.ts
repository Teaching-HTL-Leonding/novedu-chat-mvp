// ENTIRELY per request from values the caller places on the `RequestContext` (the
// activity's provider + model, and the teacher's system prompt) — mirroring how
// `tutorAgent` and the quiz discussion agent resolve their prompt/model per
// request, but without the tutor-YAML coupling.
//
// The agent has NO write/edit tool — it is read-only BY CONSTRUCTION. The only
// tool it can call is the browser-side `getCurrentText` (a frontend tool forwarded
// by @ag-ui/mastra), which returns the student's live editor buffer; there is no
// server-side capability that can mutate the student's text.
//
// SERVER-ONLY: resolves models through the `lib/llm` seam.

// RequestContext keys. Distinct from the other agents' keys so a request for one
// can never satisfy another (defense in depth on top of the runtime route's agent
// gating).

// persists and earlier turns reach the model through the recalled window after
// `trimToNewTurn`. The runtime route sets the system prompt (the activity's
// `instructions`) and model, and scopes memory to `resourceId = the code`.
