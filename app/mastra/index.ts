// Create the `mastra` schema and Mastra's own `mastra_*` tables inside it.
// `PostgresStore` auto-initializes the TABLES, but only LAZILY — on the store's first use, i.e.
// the first agent run. That is too late for us: `lib/code-stats-store.ts` reads
// `mastra_threads` / `mastra_messages` directly (the by-value join model in
// docs/codes.md), so on a database where no agent has run yet a teacher opening
// a code detail page hits "relation does not exist" and the stats panel degrades
// to "Stats temporarily unavailable".
// instrumentation.ts therefore calls this at startup, right after the Drizzle
// migrations, so the boot contract stays "every table this server reads exists
// once startup finishes". Failures propagate for the same reason migration
// failures do.
//
// The `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS` lives HERE — not in instrumentation.ts, and not
// in a Drizzle migration — because this is the one function that owns the invariant
// "the schema exists before `PostgresStore.init()` runs": keeping the statement in
// the same call site as the `init()` it guards means no second place can drift out
// of order, and every environment (prod, dev, CI, Compose) gets it from the app's
// own boot instead of from per-environment setup. A Drizzle migration would be the
// wrong home: it would pull Mastra's schema into the `novedu_*` migration history,
// which is deliberately decoupled from Mastra's (no foreign keys, no shared
// bookkeeping — docs/database.md). The app role may create schemas: it holds CREATE
// on the database, which the Drizzle migrator's own `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS
// "public"` already requires (scripts/db/provision.sql).
// Production provisioning still creates `mastra` explicitly, and that stays: created
// by the Entra admin it is OWNED by the admin with USAGE + CREATE granted to the app
// role, whereas the first boot to reach a fresh database would otherwise own the
// schema — and on the shared dev/prod server that first boot can be a developer's own
// `az login` identity. `scripts/db/reassign-ownership.sql` reassigns tables, views,
// sequences and functions only, NOT schemas, so a developer-owned `mastra` schema has
// no scripted remedy (docs/database.md, "Ownership hazard").
