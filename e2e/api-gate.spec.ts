// The proxy-matcher exclusions that had NO hermetic HTTP coverage: `/api/eval`
// and `/api/coding`. Both are listed in the `matcher` in `proxy.ts` so the
// cookie gate skips them and the route's own gate answers instead — and both
// had their gates proven only in-process (route unit tests) or behind
// `@live-llm` specs that never run in CI. An edit dropping either exclusion
// from that regex would turn every 401 below into a 302 to the Microsoft
// sign-in page and still ship through a green CI.
//
// Table-driven on purpose: adding a bearer route here is one row, and the row
// is what proves the exclusion, so new endpoints cannot quietly land untested
// (AGENTS.md: a bearer endpoint = gate + path-bounded exclusion + docs entry).
//
// Everything here fails INSIDE the gate — `requireBearerTeacher` for eval,
// `parseBearerKey` for coding, both before any store, LLM or blob call — so the
// spec stays hermetic and runs in CI.
//
// CAVEAT (local runs): reuseExistingServer means a dev server started without
// API_AUTH_JWKS_PATH in its env fails the 403 cases with 401 — restart it with
// the var exported, or let Playwright start the server.

// No cookies: these must succeed or fail on the bearer credential ALONE. With a
// session cookie present, a matcher regression would be invisible; with an empty
// storage state it turns the expected 401 into a sign-in redirect.
