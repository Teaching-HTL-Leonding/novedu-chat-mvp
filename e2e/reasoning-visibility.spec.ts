// Reasoning display is TEACHER-ONLY, and "teacher-only" here means the chain of
// thought must never be WRITTEN to a student's stream — not merely hidden in the
// DOM (docs/chat.md). A CSS-level assertion would prove nothing, so this spec
// records the raw `/api/copilotkit/agent/tutor/{run,connect}` SSE bytes the
// BROWSER received and counts `REASONING_` frames.
//
// The three legs run SERIALLY against ONE code, and in this order on purpose:
// the teacher leg first establishes that this exact activity really does produce
// reasoning frames, so the two zero-frame assertions that follow cannot pass
// merely because nothing was thinking.
//
//  1. an effective teacher            → reasoning frames present
//  2. the same teacher, view-as-student → zero
//  3. a genuine student session        → zero
//
// The three legs run against the fake LLM (docs/testing.md, "Fake LLM"): the
// `[reasoning:…]` marker makes it stream reasoning frames for EVERY session, so
// the two student legs prove the server strips them. A fourth leg, the
// `@live-llm` twin at the end, repeats the teacher leg against a real thinking
// model, so `npm run test:e2e:live-llm` keeps a real reasoning stream exercised.
// The code carries a per-code LLM override pair naming that thinking model on top
// of the plain live tutor fixture; the fake answers whatever model it is asked for.
