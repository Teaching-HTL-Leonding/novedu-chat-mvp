// The chain is built EXPLICITLY rather than using `DefaultAzureCredential`: that

// its `EnvironmentCredential` — but this app sets those for *user sign-in*

// authenticate as the wrong service principal ("server is not configured to
// accept this token"). This chain ignores those vars.

// resource lives in the ambient tenant of the `az login` identity locally and of
// the Managed Identity on Azure. That identity needs the `Reader` role on the
