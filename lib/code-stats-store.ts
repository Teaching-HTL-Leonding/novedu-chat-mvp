// The data lives across BOTH the app-owned `novedu_*` tables and Mastra's
// `mastra_*` tables, joined BY VALUE — the sanctioned cross-table pattern
// (docs/codes.md): `mastra_threads.resourceId` = the code,
// `mastra_messages.thread_id` = the thread, `novedu_user_chats.thread_id` ties a
// thread to a student (only for `anonymous: false` activities). Mastra owns its
// schema, so we only ever READ those tables with raw by-value SQL — never
// declare them to Drizzle (that would make `db:generate` try to migrate them).
// The one MUTATION of Mastra data, deleting a code's conversations, goes through
// Mastra's OWN storage API (`deleteThread`), so we still never touch its schema.
//
// "Interaction" / "conversation" throughout means a Mastra thread that has at
// least one `role = 'user'` message — a chat a student actually wrote into, not
// one merely opened. (`mastra_messages.role` is only ever 'user' or
// 'assistant' for these agents; there are no tools.)
//
// SERVER-ONLY: uses the database and the Mastra store. Never import from client
// components.

// Thread ids are server-generated UUIDs; this guards the value before it reaches
// a query, mirroring the pattern in user-chat-store / the runtime route.
