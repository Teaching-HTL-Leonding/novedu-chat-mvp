// inline `{{fragment}}` markers resolved in place) into the final `instructions`.
// The single definition shared by the render component, the `saveWriting` action, and
// the runtime route's writing branch, so they all read the same activity the same way.
//
// This file owns ONLY the app-hosted/DB seam; the resolution itself is shared verbatim
// with the prompt dump / CLI (`loadWritingFrom`), so a dumped system prompt is the exact
// production one. SERVER-ONLY: touches the database and fetches arbitrary URLs.
