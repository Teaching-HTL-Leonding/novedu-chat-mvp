// Turning an upstream LLM failure into (a) something the CALLER can act on and (b)
// something an OPERATOR can debug — two audiences, two channels, deliberately kept
// apart.
//
// The motivating case (reproduced against Azure Foundry): `--llm-model` naming a
// deployment that does not exist. Azure answers
// `404 { error: { code: "DeploymentNotFound", type: "invalid_request_error" } }`, the
// ai-sdk raises it as an `APICallError`, and a caller that collapses every failure into
// one generic sentence leaves the teacher unable to tell a typo from an outage — and,
// if that sentence is a 502, the CLI retries a request that can never succeed (four
// attempts, 30 s of backoff, per case).
//
// The inverse mistake matters just as much: blaming the caller for a SERVER fault. An
// upstream 401/403 (a rotated key, a stale Managed-Identity role) and a bare 404 from a
// misconfigured endpoint path are not the teacher's model name — the wording below
// never claims more than the status proves.
//
// SECURITY — what crosses back to the caller: the provider and model IT sent, the
// upstream HTTP status, and the upstream error CODE (a short, stable identifier like
// `DeploymentNotFound`). NOT the endpoint URL — that is the Foundry resource host, an
// infrastructure detail — and NOT the provider's free-form message, which is the field
// most likely to grow to echo request content. Both go to Application Insights instead
// (`telemetry` below, plus `recordException`'s own copy of the message), where the
// operator can already see everything the server knows.
//
// PROVIDER-AGNOSTIC by construction: the provider name is interpolated, never branched
// on — the three provider branches stay where `docs/ai-models.md` pins them.
