// every provider speaks the OpenAI `reasoning_effort` parameter, and a model that
// rejects a level fails at runtime like a wrong model name.
//
// The tuple is the UNION of the vocabularies our models speak, NOT a set every
// model accepts, and the models disagree in both directions (measured against
// SCCH, `docs/ai-models.md`): Qwen 3.8 takes `none`/`low`/`medium`/`xhigh` and
// answers `minimal`/`high`/`max` with a 400, while Gemma 4 takes every level but
// acts on only `none` — the rest are byte-identical to each other. Nothing here
// can narrow it per model (`model` is free text with no discovery), so the
// upstream call is the only validator. Order is the code form's select order
// (ascending effort).
