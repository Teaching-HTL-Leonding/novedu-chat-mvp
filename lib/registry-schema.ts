// it embeds under a stable key, reconciled with the server by `novedu codes sync`.
//
// It lives in `lib/` rather than next to the CLI for one reason: `lib/schema-gen`
// generates the editor JSON Schema from `RegistryYamlSchema` below, and cli files must
// never enter the app's tsc program (see the header of `cli/tsconfig.json`). The CLI
// inlines this module through the `@` alias like any other bundled validator.
//
// PURE and client-safe — zod only, no I/O. The parsing STRATEGY (which shapes are
// walked by hand to produce good error paths) stays in `cli/src/registry.ts`.
