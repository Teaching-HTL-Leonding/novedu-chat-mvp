// The single source that turns the zod authoring schemas into the JSON Schemas
// teachers point their editors at. zod is the source of truth (`lib/tutors/schemas.ts`,
// `lib/prompt-fragments/schemas.ts`, `lib/quiz-schema.ts`, `lib/writing-schema.ts`,
// `lib/coding-schema.ts`, `lib/registry-schema.ts`); the teacher prose lives in inline
// `.meta({ description })`.
//
// `npm run generate:schemas` (scripts/generate-activity-schemas.ts) writes the six
// files below; the hermetic drift-guard test (`generated-schemas.unit.test.ts`)
// deep-equals a fresh in-memory generation against the committed files, so an
// edited zod schema committed WITHOUT regenerating fails CI. Nothing in `app/` or
// `lib/` loads these `.schema.json` files — they are editor-only artifacts consumed
// solely by teachers' `# yaml-language-server: $schema=<github-raw-url>` modeline.
