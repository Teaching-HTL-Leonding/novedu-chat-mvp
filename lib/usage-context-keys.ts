// Shared RequestContext key names for usage attribution — mirrors the QUIZ_EVAL_*
// constants in app/mastra/quiz-agents.ts. CLIENT-SAFE: pure string constants with
// NO database or server-only imports, so the CopilotKit route, the quiz grader
// action, and the observability exporter all reference the SAME keys without a
// shared server module.
//
// The three keys are `.set(...)` on the per-request RequestContext at each agent
// seam (the CopilotKit route's `built.context`; the quiz grader's RequestContext in
// lib/quiz-actions.ts) and registered in the Observability instance's
// `requestContextKeys` (app/mastra/index.ts), so Mastra snapshots them onto every
// span's `requestContext` for app/mastra/usage-exporter.ts to read.
