// (lib/quiz-resolve.ts), which renders the quiz's two host texts and resolves the
// `quiz_files` live includes. The single definition shared by the `/q` page,
// `submitAnswer`, `startDiscussion`, and the runtime route's quiz branch, so they all
// read the same quiz the same way.
//
// This file owns ONLY the app-hosted/DB seam; the resolution itself is shared verbatim
// with the prompt dump / CLI (`loadQuizFrom`), so a dumped grading prompt is the exact
// production one. SERVER-ONLY: touches the database and fetches arbitrary URLs.
