# AI models & LLM providers

How the app talks to language models: two OpenAI-compatible providers behind one
isolated seam. Every activity YAML picks its model with `llm.model`, its
provider with `llm.provider` (`"SCCH"` when missing), and optionally a
**reasoning level** with `llm.reasoning` (below); no other code in the app
knows which provider serves a request. The YAML values are the **default**: a
code may carry a per-code `{provider, model, reasoning?}` **override**
(`novedu_codes.llm_provider`/`llm_model`/`llm_reasoning`; the pair is
both-or-nothing, `reasoning` an optional third member) that replaces the whole
`llm:` block for every request served under that code — WHOLESALE, so an
override without a level also drops the YAML's level. The precedence is
`effectiveLlm` (`lib/code-store.ts`), applied at every consumption site
(`docs/codes.md`), and the availability gate below runs on the EFFECTIVE
provider. Metering is
unaffected: the exporter reads the actually-resolved provider/model off the span
(the named-provider contract below), and the coding proxy meters its effective
pair explicitly.

Read before touching: `lib/llm/**`, `app/mastra/scch.ts`, `lib/scch-endpoint.ts`,
`buildCognitiveServicesCredential` in `lib/azure-credential.ts`, the `llm:` block
of any activity schema, and the Foundry probe in `lib/health.ts`.

## The two providers

| | SCCH | Azure Foundry |
|---|---|---|
| What | Self-hosted vLLM GPU server (free for us, Austria-only network) | Azure OpenAI resource (paid, e.g. `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4-mini`) |
| Env | `SCCH_BASE_URL` (includes `/v1`) + `SCCH_API_KEY` | `AZURE_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT` (bare resource endpoint; trailing slash tolerated) |
| API | OpenAI Chat Completions | OpenAI-compatible **v1** surface — `${endpoint}/openai/v1`, no `api-version`, the **deployment name is the `model`** |
| Auth | Static `Bearer ${SCCH_API_KEY}` | **Passwordless Entra** — no API key exists (see below) |
| `llm.model` | Raw model id (e.g. `RedHatAI/gemma-4-31B-it-FP8-Dynamic`) | Deployment name (e.g. `gpt-5.4-mini`) |

`model` is free text for both; a wrong name fails at runtime. There is no live
model discovery for Foundry (SCCH's dropdown discovery in `app/mastra/scch.ts` is
unchanged and SCCH-only). Foundry is **optional**: without
`AZURE_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT` the app boots and runs SCCH-only — everything Foundry is
built lazily on first use, and `foundryConfigured()` gates the Foundry-specific UI
(the `/health` rows). The optionality is **enforced**: on an SCCH-only server the
authoring gate (`lib/file-validators.ts`) rejects a Foundry file with a
`PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` error, and the runtime guards (quiz/writing
`buildRequestContext` → 502, the tutor loader → a thrown reason) catch a Foundry
file that arrives anyway (externally hosted YAML, an env change) — all through
`providerUnavailableReason` (`lib/llm/availability.ts`), so no chat ever dies on a
raw "AZURE_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT is not set". The CLI never runs this gate — its
bundled `loadAndCheck*` core stays environment-free.

## The `lib/llm/` seam — where the distinction lives

The provider branch exists in exactly **three functions** —
`resolveLanguageModel`, `resolveChatEndpoint` (including its `adaptBody` dialect
hook), and `providerUnavailableReason`; every call site asks one of them and never
learns which provider answered.

- `lib/llm/provider.ts` — pure, client-safe: the `LlmProvider` type, the two
  literals, `DEFAULT_PROVIDER`, the zod `providerSchema` (default `"SCCH"`) all
  four activity schemas embed, `parseLenientProvider` for the lenient runtime
  parsers, the reasoning-level counterparts (`REASONING_LEVELS`,
  `reasoningLevelSchema`, `parseLenientReasoningLevel` — below), and the ai-sdk
  **provider names** (`"scch"` / `"azure-foundry"`) with
  `providerFromModelProviderId` — the metering contract (below).
- `lib/llm/model.ts` — **the agent path**: `resolveLanguageModel(provider, model)`
  returns an ai-sdk chat model — `scchProvider.chatModel(model)` (the
  `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` spelling) or the lazily-built Foundry
  `createOpenAI(...).chat(model)` (the `@ai-sdk/openai` spelling); both pin Chat
  Completions. The two packages are deliberate — see "Two ai-sdk packages" below.
  Same file, same reason: `reasoningOptionsKey(provider)` — the `providerOptions`
  key that package reads per-request options under (a pure lookup, no
  connectivity). Imports `app/mastra/scch.ts`, so only agent modules may import
  it — never the coding route.
- `lib/llm/endpoint.ts` — **the raw path** (the coding proxy):
  `resolveChatEndpoint(provider)` → `{ url, authHeader(): Promise<string>, adaptBody(body) }`.
  Deliberately side-effect-free: it imports only the two `*-endpoint` modules, not
  `app/mastra/scch.ts` (whose top-level model discovery must not run on the lean
  public coding route). `adaptBody` is the **parameter dialect** hook the proxy
  applies after `buildUpstreamChatBody`: Azure's gpt-5.x reasoning deployments
  reject `max_tokens` (it becomes `max_completion_tokens`) and non-default
  `temperature`/`top_p` (dropped), while SCCH's vLLM speaks the classic dialect
  (identity). The hook is pure and never touches `stream`/`stream_options`
  (the usage tap's `include_usage`), `model`/`messages`, or `reasoning_effort`
  (which both dialects accept — asserted in `lib/llm/endpoint.unit.test.ts`).
- `lib/llm/availability.ts` — **the availability check** (app-only, never bundled
  by the CLI): `providerUnavailableReason(provider)` → `null` or a teacher-readable
  reason (Foundry named without `AZURE_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT`). Consumed by the
  authoring gate and the runtime guards (above).
- `lib/llm/foundry-endpoint.ts` — side-effect-free Foundry access (mirrors
  `lib/scch-endpoint.ts`): URL builders over `AZURE_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT` (throwing
  only when *called* with it unset) and `foundryBearerToken()`.
- `lib/llm/upstream-error.ts` — **the failure classifier**, provider-AGNOSTIC (it
  interpolates the provider name, never branches on it):
  `classifyUpstreamLlmError(error, { provider, model })` →
  `{ terminal, message, telemetry }`. See "Reporting an upstream failure" below.

Adding a provider = one branch in each of the three functions above + a name
constant/mapping in `provider.ts` + the schema enum literal (+ docs) + its
provider-options key in `reasoningOptionsKey` (`lib/llm/model.ts`, below).
Nothing else changes.

## Two ai-sdk packages — and why

The agent path builds its two providers from two different packages, and the split
is load-bearing:

| | SCCH | Azure Foundry |
|---|---|---|
| Package | `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` (`createOpenAICompatible`, `app/mastra/scch.ts`) | `@ai-sdk/openai` (`createOpenAI`, `lib/llm/model.ts`) |
| Chat model | `.chatModel(id)` | `.chat(id)` |
| `providerOptions` key (`reasoningOptionsKey`) | the **instance name**, `"scch"` | the fixed `"openai"` |
| Reasoning text | `reasoning_content` → ai-sdk reasoning parts | dropped (gpt-5.x emits none on Chat Completions anyway) |
| Structured output | opt-in `supportsStructuredOutputs: true` | always on |

**Why SCCH is not on `@ai-sdk/openai`.** SCCH's vLLM models stream their thinking
as `delta.reasoning_content` **before** `delta.content` (one transition chunk
carries both), and put it in `message.reasoning_content` when not streaming. The
`@ai-sdk/openai` chat-completions parser silently **drops** that field, so the
thinking text never reached the browser. `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` maps
`delta.reasoning_content ?? delta.reasoning` onto `reasoning-start` /
`reasoning-delta` / `reasoning-end` chunks (and the non-streaming field onto a
`{type: "reasoning"}` content part), which is what the rest of the pipeline —
Mastra's reasoning chunks, `@ag-ui/mastra`'s `REASONING_*` events, CopilotKit's
reasoning message — consumes (`docs/chat.md`).

**The version-line trap.** `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` is **pinned exactly** in
`package.json` (`2.0.69`). The `2.x` line is the one built on `@ai-sdk/provider`
v3 — the ai-sdk v6 generation this app runs. npm's `latest` dist-tag on that
package is `3.x` (provider v4) and must NOT be installed here; a caret range
alone is not protection enough for a dependency whose major line tracks a
different SDK generation.

**`includeUsage: true` is mandatory.** `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` sends
`stream_options.include_usage` only when the provider is built with
`includeUsage: true`. Without it a
streaming call reports no token usage, and the metering exporter reads that off
the Mastra span — so omitting it would silently zero out `usage_by_code`
(`docs/usage-metering.md`).

**`supportsStructuredOutputs: true` is mandatory.** The self-hosted vLLM honors
OpenAI-compatible `response_format: json_schema`, but `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`
defaults the flag to `false` and then **drops the schema**: it warns
("JSON response format schema is only supported with structuredOutputs") and sends a
bare `{type: "json_object"}`. Everything that grades or judges via `structuredOutput`
— the quiz grader (`lib/quiz-actions.ts`, `lib/quiz-verdict-schema.ts`) and the
teacher-only `POST /api/eval/grade` / `POST /api/eval/judge` — would then get free-form
JSON back and fail to parse, so the schema-less fallback is a silent quality
regression, not a hard error. Reasoning is unaffected: `reasoning_content` still maps
to reasoning parts alongside a `json_schema` request, streaming and not. Both flags
are guarded in `app/mastra/scch.unit.test.ts`.

**Outgoing history carries no `reasoning_content`.** The same package that maps the
INCOMING `reasoning_content` also replays it OUTWARD: converting the history for the
next request, it re-attaches a previous turn's thinking to the assistant messages.
`app/mastra/scch.ts` strips that field back off with the provider's
`transformRequestBody` hook (applied on both the generate and the stream path).
The Chat Completions dialect requires no such replay, and gemma mis-frames it: on the turn after a tool call it answers into
`reasoning_content` and leaves `content` empty, so the student sees a blank reply with
the real answer hidden in the collapsed thinking block. The strip is
**unconditional** — `model` is free text here, so a per-model branch has nothing
reliable to key on, and no house model needs its own scratchpad read back to it.
Received reasoning is untouched; only the request body changes. Guarded in
`app/mastra/scch.unit.test.ts` (construction options) and
`app/mastra/scch.wire.unit.test.ts` (the body the real package actually POSTs).
This strip is about the CURRENT turn's tool-call loop, where the reasoning is
still in memory; what Mastra SAVES carries no reasoning either, via a separate
output processor (`docs/chat.md`).

**Not the raw path.** This is the AGENT path only. The coding proxy
(`lib/coding-proxy.ts`, `lib/llm/endpoint.ts`) talks to the same endpoints with
no ai-sdk at all and is unaffected: it passes the upstream body through, so a
client asking for reasoning already gets `reasoning_content` verbatim.

## The reasoning level

Reasoning models (e.g. Foundry's gpt-5.6 deployments) accept an OpenAI
`reasoning_effort` parameter. The app models it as an optional `llm.reasoning`
field — one of `none`/`minimal`/`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh` (`REASONING_LEVELS`,
`lib/llm/provider.ts`) — in every activity YAML and as the optional third member
of the per-code override (above). Absent means the parameter is **not sent**, so
the model's own default applies. The value is provider-AGNOSTIC: it is sent to
SCCH too (both providers speak the OpenAI dialect), and a model that rejects a
level fails at runtime exactly like a wrong model name. The tuple is the UNION of
the vocabularies our models speak, not a set every model accepts. Nothing narrows
it per model — `model` is free text with no discovery — so the upstream call is
the only validator, and the code form offers every level whatever the model.

Measured on one prompt against all four house models (SCCH at `temperature: 0`,
comparing the `reasoning_content` hash; Foundry by `reasoning_tokens`). Read the
SHAPE of each column, not the absolute numbers — those are prompt-specific:

| level | SCCH Qwen 3.8 27B | SCCH Gemma 4 31B | Foundry gpt-5.6-terra | Foundry gpt-5.4-mini |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| omitted | = `xhigh` (its default) | thinks, = every level below | thinks (107 rt) | no thinking (0 rt) |
| `none` | no thinking | **no thinking** | no thinking | no thinking |
| `minimal` | **400** | identical | **400** | no thinking (0 rt) |
| `low` | 1 255 chars | identical | 98 rt | 183 rt |
| `medium` | 1 845 chars | identical | 114 rt | 207 rt |
| `high` | **400** | identical | 118 rt | 259 rt |
| `xhigh` | 2 973 chars | identical | 120 rt | 365 rt |
| `max` | **400** | identical | not probed | not probed |

Three distinct behaviours, none of which the app can know in advance:

- **A real effort ladder** — Qwen 3.8 and both gpt-5.x deployments spend
  monotonically more thinking as the level rises (Qwen's `xhigh` is ~2.4× `low`).
- **A boolean** — Gemma 4 acts on `none` alone; every other level returned the
  BYTE-IDENTICAL trace, so picking `high` over `low` there buys nothing.
- **A hard 400** — Qwen rejects the OpenAI-only names (`"Supported types are
  xhigh (default), medium, and low"`) and `max`; gpt-5.6-terra rejects `minimal`
  while gpt-5.4-mini accepts it. So `minimal` is DEPLOYMENT-specific even inside
  one provider — the reason validation cannot move server-side.

`max` stays out of `REASONING_LEVELS`: Qwen 400s on it and no house model needs
it.

`none` is NOT the same as omitting the field. It SENDS `reasoning_effort:
"none"`, turning a thinking model off; an absent level sends no parameter at all
and leaves the model's own default in place. Only the first is a way to make a
thinking model answer straight away. (SCCH additionally serves some models as
separate reasoning-ON/OFF ids — e.g. `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B-FP8 - Reasoning OFF`, a
second route to the same thing — that stays a `model` choice, not a `reasoning`
one.)

How the level reaches the wire, per path:

- **Agent path**: every agent's `model:` resolver returns `modelEntry(provider,
  model, reasoning)` (`app/mastra/model-entry.ts`) — the `ModelWithRetries[]`
  array form carrying `providerOptions: { <key>: { reasoningEffort } }`. The
  array form is REQUIRED: a bare-model return drops `providerOptions`, and
  Mastra's `modelSettings.reasoning` is a no-op on ai-sdk v3, so neither is an
  alternative. The `<key>` is PER PACKAGE, not per wire dialect (above): SCCH's
  `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` reads its options under the ai-sdk **instance name**
  (`"scch"`, the same constant behind the `scch.chat` metering id), Foundry's
  `@ai-sdk/openai` under the fixed `"openai"` whatever the instance is called.
  `reasoningOptionsKey` (`lib/llm/model.ts`, beside `resolveLanguageModel`) holds
  that as a `Record<LlmProvider, string>` — exhaustive by type, so a new provider
  cannot be added without naming its key. A wrong key is silent: the option is
  simply never parsed and `reasoning_effort` never reaches the wire, so the keys
  are asserted in `lib/llm/model.unit.test.ts` and the placement — the level filed
  under whatever key the lookup names — in `app/mastra/model-entry.unit.test.ts`.
- **Raw path** (the coding proxy): `buildUpstreamChatBody` (`lib/coding-proxy.ts`)
  pins `reasoning_effort` exactly like it pins `model` — the effective level
  OVERWRITES a client-sent value; with no level configured the client's own
  `reasoning_effort` passes through untouched.

Metering is unaffected (output tokens already include reasoning tokens,
`docs/usage-metering.md`).

## Reporting an upstream failure

When a model call fails, two different audiences need two different things, and
`classifyUpstreamLlmError` (`lib/llm/upstream-error.ts`) is the one place that splits
them. It reads the ai-sdk `APICallError` — `statusCode`, `isRetryable`, and the
OpenAI-shaped `data.error.{code,type}` envelope both providers speak — digging it out
of wrapper errors first (the ai-sdk's `RetryError`, Mastra's `cause` chain), so a
wrapped failure classifies exactly like a raw one.

- **`terminal`** — `true` when the request can never succeed as sent (a deployment name
  that does not exist, a rejected parameter), so the caller answers `4xx` and no client
  retries it. It reuses the ai-sdk's own retryability verdict, which keeps 408/409/**429**
  and 5xx retryable — a rate limit is a 4xx that must NOT become terminal. Neither is an
  upstream `401`/`403`: the provider refusing the *server's* credentials (a rotated key,
  a stale Managed-Identity role) is a server fault a token refresh may cure, so the
  caller gets a `502` that says so and retries stay live.
- **`message`** — caller-safe: the provider and model the caller itself sent, the
  upstream status, and the upstream error *code*. The commonest case, Azure's
  `404 DeploymentNotFound`, gets its own wording because a teacher hits it routinely
  (a wrong `--llm-model`) and can fix it alone — but only a proving code
  (`DeploymentNotFound`, `model_not_found`) earns that claim. A bare `404` is worded to
  cover a misconfigured server endpoint too, and a `content_filter` rejection points at
  the failing text rather than the llm settings.
- **`telemetry`** — the `recordError` attributes, and the ONLY channel for the endpoint
  URL (the Foundry resource host) and, via `recordException`, the provider's free-form
  message. Neither belongs in a response body: the host is infrastructure detail, and
  the free-form field is the one most likely to grow to echo request content. An
  operator reads both in Application Insights (`docs/telemetry.md`).

Consumed by `POST /api/eval/grade` (`docs/api.md`, `docs/cli-eval.md`). The **student**
paths deliberately do NOT use it: a student can neither fix a deployment nor be shown
infrastructure detail, so `lib/quiz-actions.ts` keeps its single generic sentence.

## Foundry auth — Managed Identity with transparent refresh

There is no Foundry API key anywhere. `foundryBearerToken()` holds ONE process-wide
`getBearerTokenProvider(buildCognitiveServicesCredential(), "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default")`
(`@azure/identity`): it caches the token and refreshes it before its ~60-minute
expiry, so callers just await a fresh bearer per request and never hold a token.
(`https://ai.azure.com/.default` also works against `*.openai.azure.com`; the
Cognitive Services scope is the canonical one.) The acquisition itself is
**bounded** (`FOUNDRY_TOKEN_TIMEOUT_MS`, 15 s, via `lib/promise-timeout.ts`): a
stuck `az` subprocess or a black-holed IMDS rejects instead of stalling a request
indefinitely, for every caller at once — the coding proxy, the agents' custom
`fetch`, and the health probe.

`buildCognitiveServicesCredential()` (`lib/azure-credential.ts`) is the same
explicit chain as the data-store credential — `AzureCliCredential` (local
`az login`) → `ManagedIdentityCredential` (on Azure) — and **never**
`DefaultAzureCredential` (same reason: the `AZURE_*` sign-in env vars belong to
user auth, not resource access). RBAC: the identity needs the
**`Cognitive Services OpenAI User`** role (`5e0bd9bd-7b93-4f28-af87-19fc36ad61bd`)
on the Foundry resource — the deployed app's Managed Identity AND each developer's
own account for local dev.

On the agent path, the bearer is injected per request by a custom `fetch` handed to
`createOpenAI` (streaming-safe); on the coding path, the route **starts**
`endpoint.authHeader()` right after the YAML load (so the token round trip overlaps
the client-body read), awaits it before the upstream fetch, and maps a failure
(missing env, no token) to its 500 config-error path.

## Server-only invariant

Endpoints, the SCCH key, and Entra tokens live in server modules only and never
reach the browser — for every module, including the coding proxy (which keeps the
teacher prompt + pinned model server-side, docs/coding.md). `provider` is part of
the activity YAML like `model`: server-read, live, never client-trusted.

## Metering contract — provider names on spans

Both provider instances are **named** (`scch` / `azure-foundry`), so Mastra
stamps `attributes.provider = "<name>.chat"` and `attributes.model` (= the YAML's
`llm.model`) on every MODEL_GENERATION span. Both packages build that id the same
way (`` `${name}.chat` ``), which is why moving SCCH from `createOpenAI` to
`createOpenAICompatible` left metering untouched — `lib/llm/model.unit.test.ts`
guards the `scch.chat` id. The usage exporter reads those
attributes and maps the name back to the app-level label via
`providerFromModelProviderId` — that is how `novedu_usage_by_code` learns its
`provider`/`model` columns (docs/usage-metering.md) with zero per-module wiring.
**Renaming a provider silently breaks that attribution** — the names are constants
in `lib/llm/provider.ts` for exactly this reason (and, for SCCH, the name doubles
as the `providerOptions` key above). The coding proxy (no Mastra)
passes `loaded.coding.provider`/`model` into `recordLlmUsage` directly.

## Health

`/health` shows Foundry rows only when `AZURE_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT` is set:
`checkFoundry()` (`lib/health.ts`) proves token acquisition (the RBAC role) and
endpoint reachability (a model listing), testids `health-foundry` /
`health-foundry-host`. An SCCH-only deployment shows no Foundry row at all.

## Testing

- **Hermetic** (`lib/llm/*.unit.test.ts`, CI): the provider schema/mapping, the
  Foundry URL normalization, `resolveChatEndpoint` shapes with a mocked token,
  and `resolveLanguageModel` model ids/provider names plus the per-provider
  `reasoningOptionsKey` (building a provider does no I/O).
  `app/mastra/model-entry.unit.test.ts` covers the rest of the reasoning seam: the
  array form, the omitted-level case, and where the level is filed.
- **Live** (`@live-llm`, local only — CI has no Managed Identity and no SCCH
  network): `e2e/tutor-chat-reply.spec.ts` runs the same smoke once per provider
  (the Foundry leg authors an app-hosted tutor and skips without
  `AZURE_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT`), and `e2e/health.spec.ts` asserts the `health-foundry`
  probe. See docs/testing.md.
