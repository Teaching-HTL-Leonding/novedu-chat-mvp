# Azure runtime environment: how Novedu is run (new environment)

How the new two-stage Azure environment is put together, what each resource is
for, how the `dev` and `prod` stages are kept apart, and how an image reaches
them. Read it before running any `az` command against `rg-novedu-shared` /
`rg-novedu-dev` / `rg-novedu-prod`, before touching
`scripts/db/provision-stage.*`, and before touching the deployment workflows.

## The staging concept

Two stages, **dev** and **prod**. Each stage owns everything that carries its
state or its rights; everything stateless and expensive to duplicate is shared.

| Per stage (isolated) | Shared between the stages |
|---|---|
| resource group, Key Vault, storage account + file share, Postgres database, App Insights, container app + its managed identity, GitHub deploy identity | Container Apps environment, Postgres *server*, container registry, Log Analytics workspace |

The isolation is what makes the shared parts safe: a stage's identity holds
rights only on its own stage's resources and can only connect to its own
database, so sharing a server or an environment never shares data.

| | dev | prod |
|---|---|---|
| Resource group | `rg-novedu-dev` | `rg-novedu-prod` |
| Container app | `ca-novedu-dev`, 0.5 vCPU / 1 GiB | `ca-novedu-prod`, 1 vCPU / 2 GiB |
| Database | `novedu_dev` | `novedu_prod` |
| Hostname | `dev.novedu.at` | `app.novedu.at` |
| Replicas | 0–1 (scales to zero) | 0–1 while the stage is empty; exactly 1 once live |

Each hostname is a custom domain on its container app (SNI binding) with a
managed certificate of the environment `cae-novedu`, validated by CNAME. The
apps still answer under their generated `*.austriaeast.azurecontainerapps.io`
names, but the app's configuration (`AUTH_URL`, `CODE_ORIGIN`) names the custom
domain, so sign-in works only there.

Everything is in **Austria East**, and every resource carries the tags
`project=novedu` and `stage=shared|dev|prod`. There is **no
infrastructure-as-code**: the environment is built from an ordered runbook of
`az` commands, dev first, prod as an exact replay with different values. That
is why every change is coordinated (`docs/azure-access.md`).

## Shared resources (`rg-novedu-shared`)

### `log-novedu` — Log Analytics

One workspace, `PerGB2018`, 30 days retention, **daily cap 0.5 GB**. It takes
the Container Apps environment's logs and backs both stages' Application
Insights resources. The cap bounds what a log storm can cost; once it is
reached, ingestion stops until the reset (17:00 UTC) — logs and telemetry of
both stages are then missing for the rest of that window, so a gap there means
"cap hit", not "nothing happened". Check it with
`az monitor log-analytics workspace show -g rg-novedu-shared -n log-novedu --query workspaceCapping`.

### `cae-novedu` — Container Apps environment

Workload-profiles environment type using **only the built-in `Consumption`
profile**; no dedicated profile is ever added. No VNet, no separate managed
infrastructure resource group. Logs go to `log-novedu`.

Its children live in the shared group even though they belong to a stage — the
two **environment storage definitions**:

| Definition | Storage account | Share | Access |
|---|---|---|---|
| `files-dev` | `stnovedudev` | `novedu-files` | ReadWrite |
| `files-prod` | `stnoveduprod` | `novedu-files` | ReadWrite |

The Azure Files mount is **key-based**, so each storage account's access key
sits in its environment storage definition. That is the one secret that cannot
live in Key Vault; one storage account per stage is what keeps it harmless,
because dev's key cannot open prod's share.

### `crnovedu` — Container Registry

Basic tier, **admin user disabled** (`crnovedu.azurecr.io`). One repository,
`novedu`, holding the images the stages run. Every tag is an immutable version
tag, `<package.json version>.<workflow run number>` (e.g. `0.1.0.126`); there is
no `:latest` here, because a stage must always name the exact version it runs.

Pushing is the pipeline's job (*Deploying and running* below). The Basic tier
has **no retention policy**, so old versions accumulate until someone purges
them:

```bash
AZURE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.htl-azure-novedu az acr run --registry crnovedu \
  --cmd "acr purge --filter 'novedu:.*' --ago 90d --keep 10 --untagged" /dev/null
```

Check first which versions the two stages currently run (*Reviewing the
environment*) — purging one of those leaves the stage unable to restart.

### `psql-novedu` — Postgres Flexible Server

| | |
|---|---|
| Version / SKU | 18, Burstable `Standard_B1ms`, 32 GB, storage auto-grow off |
| Backups | 7 days, no geo-redundant backup, no high availability |
| Network | public endpoint, TLS |
| Authentication | **Entra-only — password authentication is disabled** |
| Entra admin | the security group `novedu-dev` |
| Databases | `novedu_dev`, `novedu_prod` — each migrated by its own stage at boot. `novedu_dev` holds the copy of the production data (*Data in the dev stage*), `novedu_prod` is empty |

The firewall is an "allow Azure services" rule plus one rule per developer
machine IP. Adding one:

```bash
AZURE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.htl-azure-novedu az postgres flexible-server firewall-rule create \
  -g rg-novedu-shared --server-name psql-novedu \
  --name <rule> --start-ip-address <ip> --end-ip-address <ip>
```

## Per-stage resources

Read `dev`/`prod` for `<stage>` throughout; the two stages differ only in the
values listed above.

### Container app `ca-novedu-<stage>`

Single-revision mode, external ingress, HTTPS only, system-assigned managed
identity, Consumption profile.

Both apps run the Novedu image from `crnovedu`, pulled with the app's own
system-assigned identity (no registry credential is stored), on target port
3000, with their full configuration — secret references and environment
variables, see *Configuration* below — and the stage's Azure Files share
mounted at `/novedu-files`:

| | |
|---|---|
| Volume | `files-<stage>`, type `AzureFile`, from the environment storage definition of the same name |
| Mount path | `/novedu-files` — what `IMAGE_STORAGE_ROOT` points at (`docs/images.md`) |

Each app has three HTTP probes on the public `GET /api/version` (port 3000):

| Probe | Period | Timeout | Failure threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| Startup | 5 s | 3 s | 60 — five minutes for a boot that applies migrations |
| Liveness | 30 s | 5 s | 3 |
| Readiness | 10 s | 3 s | 3 |

The route touches neither the database nor an LLM provider, so an outage of a
dependency never restarts the container. Next.js answers requests only once
`instrumentation.ts` has finished, so the startup probe also covers the
boot-time migrations. `/api/health` is teacher-only and checks dependencies —
unsuitable on both counts.

Both scale 0–1 and are reached at their custom domain (*The staging
concept*). Prod's fixed single replica is **not built
yet**; it comes with cutover.

### Key Vault `kv-novedu-<stage>`

RBAC mode, soft delete 90 days, no purge protection. The `novedu-dev` group is
Key Vault Secrets Officer, the stage's app identity is Key Vault Secrets User.
It holds the four secrets of *Configuration* below; a secret value is never
displayed, logged or written to a file on its way in (`docs/azure-access.md`).

### Storage account `stnovedudev` / `stnoveduprod`

StorageV2, `Standard_LRS`, TLS 1.2 minimum, no public blob access, shared-key
access enabled (the Azure Files mount needs it). One file share `novedu-files`
with a 100 GiB quota.

The share is already provisioned as an **image root**: an `images/` directory
plus the `.novedu-files-root` sentinel, whose bytes come from
`scripts/lib/image-root.mjs`. Both are written through the storage API rather
than by the app, because the image adapter never creates the root, `images/` or
the sentinel and has no fallback directory — see `docs/images.md`. The share is
mounted into the stage's container app at `/novedu-files`, which is where the
app's `IMAGE_STORAGE_ROOT` points.

### Application Insights `appi-novedu-<stage>`

Workspace-based on `log-novedu`, one resource per stage, so each stage's
telemetry stays its own. The app reaches it through
`APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`, a Key Vault reference to the stage's
own connection string (`docs/telemetry.md`). The connection string must carry
`ApplicationId=`: the teacher-only `/diagnostics` page reads the resource back
through it with the app's own identity, which therefore needs **Reader** on
**its own** stage's `appi-novedu-<stage>` (`docs/diagnostics.md`) — designed,
not assigned yet.

### GitHub identity `id-novedu-gh-<stage>`

A user-assigned managed identity per stage for GitHub Actions OIDC, audience
`api://AzureADTokenExchange`:

| Identity | Federated credential subject |
|---|---|
| `id-novedu-gh-dev` | `repo:Teaching-HTL-Leonding/novedu-chat-mvp:ref:refs/heads/main` |
| `id-novedu-gh-prod` | `repo:Teaching-HTL-Leonding/novedu-chat-mvp:environment:production` |

These are the only credentials the pipeline has: **no Azure secret is stored in
GitHub**. A federated token is issued only for the exact subject above, so a
run from another branch — or a fork PR — cannot obtain one
(`docs/ci-security.md`).

## Identity and access

The complete list of role assignments inside the environment — **no identity
of one stage holds any right on the other stage's resources**:

| Principal | Rights |
|---|---|
| group `novedu-dev` | Owner on the three resource groups; Key Vault Secrets Officer on both vaults; Entra admin of `psql-novedu` |
| `ca-novedu-<stage>` (system-assigned MI) | AcrPull on `crnovedu`; Key Vault Secrets User on **its own** stage's vault; a Postgres role in **its own** stage's database; Reader on **its own** stage's `appi-novedu-<stage>` (designed, not assigned yet) |
| `id-novedu-gh-dev` | AcrPush on `crnovedu`; Contributor on the resource `ca-novedu-dev` |
| `id-novedu-gh-prod` | AcrPull on `crnovedu`; Contributor on the resource `ca-novedu-prod` |

Only the dev GitHub identity may push images; the prod one only pulls and
updates its own app, so a promotion can never introduce a new image.

Human access runs entirely on the group's rights — nobody needs a personal role
assignment. Group membership therefore includes prod; see
`docs/azure-access.md` for what that means during the transition period.

The resource groups also **inherit every assignment made on the subscription**
`Novedu`. There it is the subscription Owners only — no Contributor, no service
principal. Anyone added at that scope reaches everything in both stages: the
storage keys, a shell in the running container (and with it the resolved
secrets), and the right to appoint a Postgres Entra admin. Keep that scope to
the Owners; *Reviewing the environment* lists it.

### Delete locks

A `CanNotDelete` lock named `no-delete` sits on each resource that holds data
or secrets the runbook cannot rebuild: `psql-novedu`, `stnovedudev`,
`stnoveduprod`, `kv-novedu-dev` and `kv-novedu-prod`. It blocks deleting the
resource and anything below it on the management plane — a database, a file
share, a role assignment scoped to the resource — but no data operation: rows,
files and secret versions are written and deleted as before. Deleting such a
resource on purpose starts with `az lock delete`.

## Configuration

Both stages are configured in full: every secret sits in the stage's own Key
Vault, the container app references it there, and the plain settings are on the
app. Read `dev`/`prod` for `<stage>` throughout.

### Secrets

Four secrets per stage, under **identical names in both vaults**. Each is wired
into the container app as a Key Vault reference,
`keyvaultref:<versionless secret URI>,identityref:system`, so the app resolves
it when a revision starts, using its own system-assigned identity — which is
Key Vault Secrets User on its own stage's vault only. The reference is
versionless, so a new secret version needs no change to the app.

| Key Vault secret | App secret | Environment variable | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AUTH-SECRET` | `auth-secret` | `AUTH_SECRET` | dev: the same value as the old environment. prod: its own, randomly generated (32 bytes, base64) |
| `AZURE-CLIENT-SECRET` | `azure-client-secret` | `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` | dev: the secret of the registration *Novedu Chat MVP*, shared with the old environment, expiring 2028-06-08. prod: the secret `novedu-prod` of *Novedu Chat (prod)*, expiring 2028-09-20. The vault secret's `expires` attribute carries the same date |
| `SCCH-API-KEY` | `scch-api-key` | `SCCH_API_KEY` | the one SCCH key — the **only** secret that is identical in both stages and the old environment |
| `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS-CONNECTION-STRING` | `appinsights-connection-string` | `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` | the stage's own `appi-novedu-<stage>` |

Apart from the SCCH key no secret is shared between the stages, so
compromising dev's vault tells nobody anything about prod. Dev's `AUTH_SECRET`
and client secret are, however, the old environment's values: until cutover,
whoever reads dev's vault holds two secrets of the live production.

### Environment variables

Plain values on the container app, beside the four secret references:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://ca-novedu-<stage>@psql-novedu.postgres.database.azure.com/novedu_<stage>?sslmode=require` |
| `AUTH_URL` | `https://<the stage's hostname>/api/auth` |
| `CODE_ORIGIN` | `https://<the stage's hostname>` |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | `91fc072c-edef-4f97-bdc5-cfb67718ae3a` (both stages) |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | dev `4d44fc4b-0434-4981-9765-62e2074ceecb`, prod `d36756ba-5d79-4809-8a01-896d02639a34` |
| `TEACHER_GROUP_ID` | `1adac4e1-be54-458c-90ef-318d89f83317` (both stages) |
| `SCCH_BASE_URL` | `https://llm2go-api.scch.at/v1` |
| `IMAGE_STORAGE_ROOT` | `/novedu-files` |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | `novedu-chat-<stage>` |

`DATABASE_URL` carries **no password**: the app authenticates with its managed
identity token (`lib/db/pool.ts`, `docs/database.md`).

The hostname is the stage's custom domain, `dev.novedu.at` or `app.novedu.at`.
`AUTH_URL` is better-auth's base URL: it builds the OAuth `redirect_uri` from
it, while the state cookie lives on the host the browser started from — so a
value that differs from the host people use breaks sign-in. Changing a stage's
hostname therefore means changing `AUTH_URL` and `CODE_ORIGIN`, the stage's
`*_BASE_URL` GitHub variable, adding the new callback to that stage's app
registration, and rewriting `novedu_codes.file_url` (*Data in the dev
stage*).

### Deliberately not set

- **`AZURE_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` / `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`** —
  the new stages run on **SCCH only**. A provider's variables are its switch:
  without them the app boots normally, `providerUnavailableReason` reports the
  provider as not configured (visible on `/health`), every default provider
  is SCCH, and an activity or code that names Azure Foundry or OpenRouter is
  rejected as unavailable on these stages (`docs/ai-models.md`).
- **`STORAGE_TENANT_ID`** — it only pins the tenant of a local `az` credential
  and means nothing to a managed identity.
- **`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`** — it would win over the Application
  Insights connection string; telemetry goes to Azure Monitor
  (`docs/telemetry.md`).

### Sign-in app registrations

Sign-in runs against the tenant that hosts the environment, through two Entra
app registrations in it:

| Registration | Client id | Used by | Redirect URIs |
|---|---|---|---|
| *Novedu Chat MVP* | `4d44fc4b-0434-4981-9765-62e2074ceecb` | `ca-novedu-dev`, the old environment, local development | `https://dev.novedu.at/api/auth/callback/microsoft` beside the old environment's and localhost's |
| *Novedu Chat (prod)* | `d36756ba-5d79-4809-8a01-896d02639a34` | `ca-novedu-prod` | `https://app.novedu.at/api/auth/callback/microsoft` |

Both are single-tenant, carry `groupMembershipClaims: All` with the optional
`groups` claim on the id and the access token — that is what `TEACHER_GROUP_ID`
is matched against — request Graph `User.Read` with per-user consent, and grant
no implicit flow.

Accounts are keyed by the Entra `oid`, which is tenant-wide, so the same person
is the same user under both registrations; the two stages nevertheless share no
data, because each has its own database (`docs/auth.md`).

### Setting or rotating a secret

The value goes in on stdin — never in an argument, and never displayed, in a
terminal or a Claude session (`docs/azure-access.md`):

```bash
export AZURE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.htl-azure-novedu

az keyvault secret set --vault-name kv-novedu-<stage> --name <NAME> \
  --file /dev/stdin --encoding utf-8 -o none
```

Because the app's reference is versionless, the new value is picked up by the
next revision — or immediately with
`az containerapp revision restart -g rg-novedu-<stage> -n ca-novedu-<stage> --revision <revision>`.

A client secret expires, so check it before it does. The `expires` attribute
of `AZURE-CLIENT-SECRET` mirrors the registration's end date — Key Vault does
not enforce it, it only makes the date visible (and lets a near-expiry event
fire); set it again with `az keyvault secret set-attributes --expires <date>
-o none` whenever the secret is rotated:

```bash
az ad app credential list --id <client id> \
  --query "[].{name:displayName,end:endDateTime}" -o table
az keyvault secret show --vault-name kv-novedu-<stage> -n AZURE-CLIENT-SECRET \
  --query attributes.expires -o tsv
```

## Postgres roles and stage isolation

Both stages live on one server, so the stage boundary is a **privilege, not a
network rule**. Each stage is provisioned with

```bash
AZURE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.htl-azure-novedu node scripts/db/provision-stage.mjs <dev|prod>
```

and verified with the same command plus `--check`. The runner substitutes the
stage's identifiers into `scripts/db/provision-stage.sql`, picks the database
each block runs on, and skips the two statements Postgres cannot express
idempotently, so **re-running is safe**; `--check` changes nothing and exits 1
when an expectation fails. The password is an Entra access token fetched from
the ambient `az` profile — which is why the script refuses to run without
`AZURE_CONFIG_DIR`.

Per stage it produces:

- the app's managed identity registered as the Postgres role
  `ca-novedu-<stage>` — a plain login role with exactly the privilege model of
  `docs/database.md`: `CONNECT` + `CREATE` on its database, `USAGE` + `CREATE`
  on the schemas `public` and `mastra`, owning what it creates at boot;
- the database owned by the group role, not by the app role;
- `revoke create on schema public from public`;
- `revoke connect on database … from public`, so a stage's identity cannot even
  open a connection to the other stage's database.

**Humans connect as the group.** A group member logs in with the group name
`novedu-dev` as the Postgres user and their own Entra token as the password, so
every developer's connection string is identical.

**Dev only:** the group is a member of `ca-novedu-dev` and

```sql
alter role "novedu-dev" in database novedu_dev set role = 'ca-novedu-dev';
```

makes every group session act as the dev app role automatically — a fresh
session reports `current_user=ca-novedu-dev`, `session_user=novedu-dev`. Objects
created by a developer's local boot are therefore owned by the app role from
the start, and the **ownership hazard** of `docs/database.md` cannot occur in
`novedu_dev`. The flip side: admin work inside that database starts with `SET
ROLE NONE` (which the provisioning script does itself). `novedu_prod` has no
such default; there the group is a plain admin.

## Data in the dev stage

`novedu_dev` and the dev image share hold a **copy of the production data**, so
the stage can be exercised with realistic content. It is real student and
teacher data: treat the dev stage like production when it comes to exporting or
sharing what is in it. The prod stage stays empty until cutover.

The copy differs from production in four deliberate ways:

- **No chat messages.** `mastra.mastra_messages` is empty; the threads exist, so
  a stored chat opens with an empty transcript.
- **No credentials.** `novedu_session`, `novedu_device_code`,
  `novedu_verification` and `novedu_coding_keys` are empty, and the token
  columns of `novedu_account` are null — session tokens and coding API keys are
  stored in plaintext and would otherwise be working credentials on this stage.
  Everyone signs in fresh; students request a new coding key.
- **App-hosted file URLs point at the dev stage.** `novedu_codes.file_url` is an
  absolute URL, and the app resolves it from its own database only when it
  starts with the stage's `CODE_ORIGIN`; any other origin is fetched over
  HTTPS. Every `…/api/files/…` URL of the production hostnames is therefore
  rewritten to the dev origin. Changing a stage's hostname needs the same
  rewrite. The current copy predates the custom domain and carries the
  generated origin `https://ca-novedu-dev.salmonmeadow-98d2bbff.austriaeast.azurecontainerapps.io`:
  those files are fetched over HTTPS from that still-reachable host, which
  works but bypasses the database shortcut. The final data transfer writes
  the stage's hostname.
- **Only active images.** The share holds the bytes of the active image rows
  under `images/<key>/content`; closed rows have no bytes in production either.

Sign-in needs no mapping: both environments authenticate against the same Entra
tenant and teacher group, so a user's `oid` finds their copied
`novedu_account` row and the teacher flag is recomputed as usual.

The copy is a `pg_dump` of the schemas `public` and `mastra` restored with
`--no-owner --no-acl --role=ca-novedu-dev` into the stopped stage, without the
dump's schema entries — the stage's schemas and grants stay as provisioned, and
every restored object is owned by the app role (`provision-stage.mjs dev
--check` verifies it). There is no `pg_dump` on the dev machines; the
`postgres:18` container image provides it.

## Deploying and running

Development is **trunk-based**: `main` is the only long-lived branch, and the
stages are deployment targets, not branches. One image is built once per merge
to `main` and both stages run that same artifact — prod never gets a separately
built one.

| Step | Where | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Publish | `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` | QA gate, then the image is built **once** under the version tag and released to production (the old environment — Docker Hub plus the App Service webhook; legacy, it goes away at cutover). |
| Deploy to dev | its `deploy-dev` job | Copies that very image registry-to-registry into `crnovedu` (same digest) and deploys it to `ca-novedu-dev`. A **separate job**, so a problem in the new environment never blocks the production release, and a red `deploy-dev` leaves production untouched. |
| Promote to prod | `.github/workflows/promote.yml`, manual | Verifies the version exists in `crnovedu` and deploys it to `ca-novedu-prod`. **Nothing is built.** |

Both deploy steps go through the composite action
`.github/actions/deploy-stage`: `az containerapp update --image`, then poll the
stage's `/api/version` until it reports that version (10 minutes, revision list
printed on timeout). **Green means the stage answers with the version** — the
poll also wakes a scaled-to-zero app. Database migrations run at app boot, per
stage, so deploying to a stage migrates that stage's database.

### Promoting and rolling back

```bash
gh workflow run promote.yml -f version=0.1.0.126   # a specific version
gh workflow run promote.yml                        # the version dev currently runs
```

An empty `version` resolves to what dev reports at `/api/version`. **Rollback is
the same command with an older version.** Migrations are forward-only, so
rolling back across one only works if that migration was backward-compatible.

### GitHub configuration

No Azure secret is involved anywhere — all of this is plain repository or
environment **variables** (`docs/ci-security.md`).

| Scope | Name | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| repository variable | `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | the tenant and subscription of `docs/azure-access.md` |
| repository variable | `AZURE_DEV_CLIENT_ID` | client id of `id-novedu-gh-dev` |
| repository variable | `DEV_BASE_URL` | dev's public base URL, no trailing slash |
| environment `production` | `AZURE_PROD_CLIENT_ID` | client id of `id-novedu-gh-prod` |
| environment `production` | `PROD_BASE_URL` | prod's public base URL, no trailing slash |

The `production` environment's deployment branches are **`main` only**; it is
what the prod identity's federated subject matches, so it is part of the trust
chain, not a convenience. A required reviewer can be added to it without
touching the workflow. The two `*_BASE_URL` variables carry the stages'
custom domains, `https://dev.novedu.at` and `https://app.novedu.at`.

### Constraints the pipeline respects

- **One replica per stage is a hard limit** (dev 0–1, prod exactly 1 once
  live). The Drizzle migrator takes no lock, and the pool maximum of 20
  connections (`lib/db/pool.ts`) is sized against what a `Standard_B1ms`
  offers (50).
- **Single-revision mode** keeps the old revision serving until the new one is
  ready, so a failed boot-time migration leaves the stage on its previous
  revision.
- **The probes poll `/api/version`**, the same route the pipeline polls, and
  the startup probe allows a boot five minutes. `az containerapp update
  --image` keeps them.
- **Dev scales to zero**, so the first request after an idle period pays a cold
  start that includes the boot-time migration check.

## Reviewing the environment

Read-only; safe at any time, unlike anything that creates or changes a
resource (`docs/azure-access.md`).

```bash

`az containerapp` works from the core CLI. The extension this profile needs is
`application-insights`, for any `az monitor app-insights` command; extensions
are installed per profile (`docs/azure-access.md`).
