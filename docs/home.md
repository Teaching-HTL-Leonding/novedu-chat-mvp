# Start page, achievements engine, saved quiz results & Settings

The start page (`/`) is every signed-in user's home, by **effective** role:

- **Students** (and a teacher in view-as-student mode): the code field and
  Recently used, then the user's own progress — XP and level, a weekly streak, a
  26-week calendar with badges pinned to their days, medals and retake reminders
  from saved quiz results, the badges closest to being earned, and all badges by
  family.
- **Teachers**: a dashboard over the codes they created — what needs them
  (codes closing soon, open reports, codes never used), six KPIs over the last
  30 days, their most-used activities, and their own badges (*Teacher dashboard*
  below).

The Settings page (`/settings`) holds the per-user preferences. Visual design:
`DESIGN.md`, `.impeccable/surfaces/app-page-tsx.md` (students) and
`.impeccable/surfaces/app-home-teacher-home-tsx.md` (teachers).

Everything about progress is **private to the user**: no teacher view, no
comparison, no leaderboard. The page says so ("Your progress here is only
visible to you."). The teacher dashboard reads only the teacher's own codes and
only counts — it never names a student.

## Time rules

Usage buckets are UTC hours (`docs/usage-metering.md`); every day, week and hour
on the page is a **Vienna-local** cut of them (`HOME_TIME_ZONE`).

- **Active hour** — a `novedu_usage_by_user` bucket with
  `user_messages + quiz_answers + writing_saves + coding_requests > 0`; token-only
  buckets don't count. On the autumn clock change the two buckets sharing local
  02:00 are two hours; the missing spring hour has no bucket.
- **Coding hours of a day** — the distinct Vienna-local hours (0–23) with a coding
  request; the two autumn 02:00 buckets are one hour here.
- **Active day** — a local date with at least one active hour.
- **Week** — ISO week, keyed by the local date of its Monday (a week crossing New
  Year is one key).
- **Weekly streak (shown)** — consecutive active weeks ending at the current week,
  or at last week while the current week has no active day yet.
- **Longest streak (granted)** — the longest run in the whole history; streak
  badges come from it, so a break never takes one away.
- **Heatmap** — the current ISO week and the 25 before it; intensity 0 / 1 / 2–3 /
  4+ active hours; days after today are marked future.
- **Day distance** — the difference of local calendar dates, not elapsed hours;
  every "≥ n days" rule uses it.
- **School hours** — Monday to Friday, local hours `8 ≤ h < 17`
  (`SCHOOL_DAY_START` / `SCHOOL_DAY_END`, `isSchoolHour`). A bucket outside them —
  a weekend, or a weekday before 08:00 or from 17:00 — is *outside school hours*.
  Whole hours only; school holidays are not known and count like any weekday.

## Quiz scores, medals and nudges

- **Score** — `(correct + 0.5 × partial) / total`; unanswered counts as wrong.
  Scores are compared as exact fractions (`2 × correct + partial` over
  `2 × total`, cross-multiplied in BigInt), never as rounded percentages. The page
  shows whole percent rounded **down**, so 100 % always means gold.
- **Medal** of a quiz, from its best saved attempt — gold = every slot correct,
  silver ≥ 80 %, bronze ≥ 50 %, else none. "Best" is the highest score, ties to the
  newest attempt (`finished_at`, then id) — the same row the store's prune keeps.
- **Refresh nudge** — a saved quiz whose last attempt is ≥ 5 days old AND (below
  gold OR > 14 days old) AND whose code exists with an open window. At most three,
  oldest last attempt first, ties by code; each shows last and best score and links
  to `/<code>`.

## Catalog and rules

An entry (`Achievement<F, G>` in `catalog.ts`, over an audience's facts `F` and
fact groups `G`) has a stable `id`, an audience, a family, an
order, an icon key, name, criterion, `hidden`, `xp`, the fact groups it `needs`,
and a pure `evaluate(facts)` that returns either `{ earned, qualifiedOn }` — the
local date on which the evidence was **first** complete — or
`{ current, target }`.

- Every rule is a **lifetime** predicate. A stored grant stays earned whatever the
  facts say later.
- Ids are generic catalog keys (`weekly-streak-4`), never containing a code, so
  `novedu_achievements` can never become a user↔code link. A tier ladder is
  `<ladder>-<n>`.
- The catalog is imported only by server modules. A guard test walks every
  `"use client"` module's value-import closure (stopping at `"use server"`
  modules) and fails if it reaches `catalog.ts`. Hidden entries reach the page
  data only once earned, so their names never ship to the browser before that.
- No achievement rewards a time of day or a chat-message count.

Families on the page:

- **Rhythm** — weekly streak 2/4/8/16, 3 and 5 active days in a week, 10/30/100
  active days.
- **Practice** — quiz answers 10/100/500, writing saves 5/25/100.
- **Quiz mastery** (from saved results) — First Result, Gold (every answer of a
  quiz correct) / Three Golds / Ten Golds (distinct quizzes, one ladder
  `quiz-golds-1/3/10`), Improved (an attempt beating the best of ALL earlier saved
  attempts of that quiz), Refreshed (two consecutive saved attempts of one quiz ≥ 5
  days apart). The rules read only the retained rows; "consecutive" is evaluated
  inside the newest-50 run, so the extra best row beyond it is never paired across
  the gap.
- **Coding** — Connected (a first coding key, dated to its issue day), First
  Request (the first day with a coding request), coding days 5/20, Toolbelt (keys
  for 3 coding activities).
- **Secret** (`hidden`) — Full Stack (chat, quiz, writing and coding inside one
  ISO week), In the Zone (coding in 3 different local hours of one day) and Bug
  Hunter (an own report was resolved, dated to the resolution day). The
  column shows only earned ones plus the note "Secret badges show up here once you
  earn them."; an unearned secret badge is never in Almost there, the Badges
  section, or any page data.

**Almost there** lists the next unearned tier of each ladder (a higher tier can't
be earned first) among listed entries with progress, closest to its target first,
catalog order breaking ties, at most four. The **Badges** section shows, per
family, the earned badges first, then the next tier of each ladder; "Show all
badges" reveals the rest.

The teacher families (no XP, none hidden) are under *Teacher dashboard*.

**XP** (students) = 10 × active days + Σ `xp` of the stored grants. Level `n` starts at
`50 · n · (n − 1)` XP. Computed on every load, never stored; monotonic because
neither active days nor grants are ever deleted.

## Evaluation flow

The same for both audiences, each over its own catalog (`settleGrants` in
`lib/home-data.ts`). Both share `novedu_achievements`: the ids of the two
catalogs never collide (guard-tested), and each page evaluates only its own.

1. `lib/home-data.ts` loads the facts and the stored grants in parallel.
2. `evaluate` runs the catalog. A stored grant wins; a rule runs only when every
   group in its `needs` loaded — **a failed group is never read as zero**.
   Qualifying entries without a row are new grants.
3. New grants are inserted **before the load returns**
   (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING`; a concurrent tab's rows are
   re-read), so the page renders only durable state. If the insert fails, the
   grant-dependent sections are unavailable for that load.
4. A grant with `seen_at IS NULL` is new: the page shows a quiet strip with the
   count, marks those badges on the calendar and in the Badges section, and the
   client calls `markAchievementsSeen(ids)` once the strip has rendered. The action
   sets `seen_at` only on the **session user's** still-unseen rows of those ids.

## Facts

Each group is one statement keyed by the session user id and fails
independently.

- **Usage** (`loadStudentUsage`) — `novedu_usage_by_user` grouped by Vienna-local
  day over the whole history: active hours, the per-day counters (messages, quiz
  answers, writing saves, coding requests) and the coding hours. A range scan on
  the PK `(user_id, hour)`; the `@live-db` home spec checks the plan.
- **Keys** (`listOwnKeyDates`, `lib/coding-key-store.ts`) — the Vienna-local issue
  dates of the user's own coding keys, oldest first; nothing else leaves the
  store. A range scan on `ix_novedu_coding_keys_user_id`, plan-checked too.
- **Quiz** (`listOwnQuizResults`, `lib/quiz-result-store.ts`) — the user's saved
  results, each with its code's note and whether the code is open now (a left
  join on `novedu_codes`, the same window rule as `checkCode`). A range scan over
  the user's rows, plan-checked.
- **Reports** (`listOwnResolvedReportDates`, `lib/report-store.ts`) — the
  Vienna-local dates the user's OWN reports were resolved; nothing else leaves the
  store. A scan of the partial index `ix_novedu_reports_user_id_resolved`,
  plan-checked.
- **Grants** (`listGrants`) — the user's `novedu_achievements` rows.

Coding activity is read from `coding_requests`, which the coding proxy counts
per metered response (`docs/usage-metering.md`).

The student facts never read `novedu_user_chats`, `novedu_recent_codes` or any
other user's rows. Recently used comes from `lib/recent-code-store.ts` and never
depends on the engine.

## Teacher dashboard

Everything covers the codes with `created_by` = the session user; the window is
the last 30 Vienna-local days, today included (`windowStart`: local midnight 29
days ago). A teacher's own test runs count in their codes' usage — the data
cannot tell them apart.

**Facts** (`loadTeacherFacts`, six statements in parallel, each failing alone;
the grants are the seventh):

- **Codes** (`listTeacherCodes`) — module, note, window, created-at; a scan of
  `ix_novedu_codes_created_by`. A code with an unknown module is dropped.
- **Usage** (`loadTeacherUsage`) — `novedu_usage_by_code` joined to those codes,
  per code and Vienna-local day over the whole history: interactions (messages +
  quiz answers + writing saves + coding requests), the part of them outside
  school hours, quiz answers, input tokens (new + cached) and output tokens. The
  window's sums are derived from it in pure code (`codeUsage`); every code with a
  usage row **ever** has at least one day, so "never used" means no row at all.
  The school-hours cut in SQL uses the same constants as `isSchoolHour`.
- **Conversations** — threads of those codes with a user message in the window
  (the `EXISTS` shape of `getDashboardKpis`, `docs/dashboard.md`).
- **Identified students** — distinct user ids, all time, over the per-user chats
  (`novedu_user_chats`) and saved texts (`novedu_writing_submissions`) of codes
  whose frozen `anonymous` flag is false, and the key holders of their coding
  codes (`novedu_coding_keys` — a key proves the activity was opened, not used);
  the teacher's own id excluded. Each subselect comes from the store that owns its
  table. Per code, the count and the local dates on which the first 100
  students were first seen (a saved text keeps only its last save, so it dates
  the student no earlier than that); plus the overall count. Only counts and
  dates leave the statement.
- **Reports** (`loadTeacherReports`, `lib/report-store.ts`) — one row of scalar
  subselects: the unresolved reports per own code, and the reports the teacher
  resolved (`resolved_by`, on any code — every teacher can review every code's
  reports) with the local dates of the first ten, read through the partial
  `ix_novedu_reports_resolved_by`.
- **Files** (`loadWriterVersions`, `lib/file-store.ts`) — over the `novedu_files`
  versions the teacher wrote (`ix_novedu_files_created_by`): the most versions of
  one name, and the local date some name first reached five. No name or content
  leaves the store.

The teacher facts never read the students' saved quiz results (that store has no
teacher reader at all) and never return a student id or name. The `@live-db`
spec checks that every statement starts from its index (`ix_novedu_codes_created_by`,
plus the resolver and writer indexes for reports and files) and has no
sequential scan.

**Page** (`buildTeacherHome` → `TeacherHome`): the greeting with the Teacher Guide
link (`TEACHER_GUIDE_URL`, a new tab), then:

- **Needs you** — three counters, each listing up to five codes linked to their
  detail page (`/codes/<code>`) plus how many more there are. The first counter
  with something in it starts open; one panel at a time; an empty counter reads
  "all clear" and is no button; a counter whose group failed says so.
  - *Closing soon*: open now and the window ends within 3 days, soonest first;
    "Closes today" is shown in the destructive tone.
  - *Open reports*: the number of unresolved reports; the codes with the most
    first; the panel links to `/reports` (which defaults to open reports on your
    own codes).
  - *Never used*: created more than 7 days ago, open now, no usage row ever;
    oldest first.
- **Last 30 days** — Live codes (open now, the `checkCode` window rule),
  Identified students (labelled: anonymous activities cannot be counted),
  Conversations, Quiz answers, Input tokens, Output tokens. A KPI whose group
  failed says "Unavailable", never 0.
- **Top activities** — the five codes with the most interactions in the window
  (ties by code): note, kind, interactions, and the share outside school hours
  (rounded percent; the column's info button explains the rule). Links to the
  usage dashboard (`/usage`), which covers every code.

- **Badges** — the student page's Badges section and discs (`BadgesSection`
  with `audience="teacher"`), with the teacher families in their own colours; no
  XP, nothing hidden. New badges are announced by the student page's strip
  (`NewsStrip`), above Needs you, and marked seen the same way.

**Teacher achievements** (`TEACHER_CATALOG`; every rule over the teacher's own
codes and rows, dated to the local day its evidence was first complete):

| Family | Achievement | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Reach | First Code | the first code created |
| Reach | Full Toolkit | a tutor, a quiz, a writing and a coding code created (dated by the fourth kind's first code) |
| Reach | Small Crowd / Full Class / Packed House (`crowd-10/30/100`) | 10 / 30 / 100 identified students on ONE activity — never added up across activities |
| Reach | Busy / Buzzing / Hive of Activity (`busy-100/1000/5000`) | 100 / 1,000 / 5,000 interactions on one activity (a running total) |
| Authoring | Evergreen | one activity used in 8 different ISO weeks |
| Authoring | Iterator | 5 versions of one file written by the teacher |
| Authoring | Listener | 10 reports resolved |
| Authoring | Homework Hit | one activity with at least 50 interactions, at least half of them outside school hours (running totals; shows its criterion only, no count) |

Facts that no longer hold (a deleted code, a reopened report) never take back a
stored badge.

A teacher without any code sees the greeting, the Teacher Guide, one line
pointing to it, and the badges to earn (First Code first).

## Page and loading

`app/page.tsx` resolves the session and the **effective** role
(`effectiveTeacherForSession`, `docs/auth.md`) and renders one of two shells at
once; each data section is an async server component behind its own
`<Suspense>`.

- **Student** (also a teacher in view-as-student mode, built from the teacher's
  own usage), in this order on every width: Continue (code field + Recently
  used), the new-badges strip, progress (level/XP + streak), the calendar, Time to
  refresh beside Almost there (stacked below `lg`), Badges.
- **Teacher**: the header (with the no-codes line in its own boundary), the
  new-badges strip, Needs you, Last 30 days, Top activities, Badges. The strip and
  the Badges section are the student page's components, given the audience.

Without a resolvable session only the code field renders.

Sections degrade independently. Teacher: Badges and the strip need the grants; a
badge whose group failed is left out unless already stored. Student: Level/XP,
Almost there and Badges need usage and grants; the streak and the calendar need usage; the calendar's pins and the strip
need grants. A section whose group failed shows the "could not be loaded" note,
never zeros. Time to refresh needs only the quiz group. When only one of the
keys / quiz / reports groups failed, the badges that read it are left out unless
already stored, everything else renders, and the load is not cached.

## Load protection

A student refreshing in a loop must not load the database.

- **Per-user cache** (`lib/home-cache.ts`): a completed result is reused for 60 s
  per `(userId, audience)` key (`<id>:student`, `<id>:teacher`) — a refresh inside
  the window runs no statement. The statement count per role is fixed (four
  student groups plus grants, six teacher groups plus grants) and never grows
  with the number of codes.
  In-process memory is correct because a stage runs at most one replica.
- **Single flight**: concurrent loads of one key share one promise, held in a map
  separate from completed entries; a promise's cleanup removes only its own entry.
- **Invalidation wins**: invalidation drops both entries; a load publishes only
  while its promise is still the key's in-flight entry, so a caller after an
  invalidation never receives a load that started before the write.
- **Bound**: at most 2,000 completed entries, oldest evicted; in-flight loads are
  never evicted. No per-key state lives outside these two maps.
- **Browser**: the writes below also call `revalidatePath("/")`, so a start page
  in the router cache never comes back from Back/Forward with stale results
  (`markAchievementsSeen` does not: it would re-render the page being viewed).
- **Not cached**: a load with any failed group (or a failed grant insert).
- **Invalidation**: `markAchievementsSeen`, `saveQuizResult`,
  `updateUserSettings` and `deleteMyQuizResults` invalidate the user's keys; so do
  the acting teacher's code writes (`createCodeAction`, `updateCodeAction`,
  `deleteSelectedCodesAction`) and report writes (mark resolved, reopen, delete),
  which also call `revalidatePath("/")`. Everything else — another teacher's edit,
  a code created through the API or `codes sync` — is at most 60 s stale.
- React `cache()` shares one load between the sections of a request.

## Saving a quiz result

Quiz grading itself persists nothing. Only on the student's explicit choice does
the Finish page store the attempt's **counts** — never an answer — in
`novedu_quiz_results`, the third sanctioned user↔code link (`docs/codes.md`).

- **Finish page** (`save-result.tsx`). With the setting off it asks "Save this
  result to your personal statistics? Only you can see it — your teacher cannot."
  with **No** (nothing stored; asked again next time), **This time** (one row) and
  **Always** (the row plus the setting on). With the setting on it saves at once
  and says so, linking to Settings. An attempt with nothing answered is never
  saved. The attempt's uuid is minted in the browser when the attempt starts.
- **`saveQuizResult`** (`lib/quiz-actions.ts`) re-runs the quiz verification on
  every call (session, `checkCode`, module = quiz, the quiz re-loaded via
  `verifyAndLoadQuiz` in `lib/quiz-verify.ts`) and rejects — never clamps — a
  non-uuid attempt id, a count that is not a non-negative int4, counts that don't
  sum to `total`, nothing answered, and a `total` above the attempt length the
  server derives (`question_count`, else the pool size). Modes: `this-time`
  writes the row; `always` upserts the setting and writes the row in one
  transaction; `automatic` re-reads the setting inside the transaction and writes
  only while it is on (else the Finish page asks). It returns nothing about the
  quiz.
- **Transaction** (`saveQuizResult` in the store): `pg_advisory_xact_lock` on
  `(user, code)`, then the code row `FOR SHARE` (gone → nothing written), then the
  setting, the insert (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on `(user_id, id)`) and the prune —
  keep the newest 50 by `(finished_at, id)` plus the best one. `deleteCodesAndData`
  locks its code rows `FOR UPDATE` (in code order) before deleting their dependent
  rows, results included, so a save never lands after its code's delete.
  `updateUserSettings` and `deleteMyQuizResults` take the settings row lock, so
  they serialize with automatic saves.
- **Trust**: the counts come from the browser, so a student can forge their own
  result — accepted: only they see it, and the XP it reaches is bounded.
- **No teacher surface, by construction**: the store's functions are keyed by the
  session user id (plus `deleteResultsForCode`, which returns nothing). A guard
  test (`lib/quiz-result-isolation.unit.test.ts`) fixes its importers —
  `lib/quiz-actions.ts`, `lib/student-facts-store.ts`, `lib/code-stats-store.ts`,
  `lib/user-settings-actions.ts`, `app/settings/page.tsx` — and fails if any other
  module under `lib/` or `app/` names the table.

## Settings page

`/settings`, reached from the user menu by every signed-in user in either role. A
list of sections, each backed by a column of `novedu_user_settings` (a table of
its own: `novedu_user` belongs to better-auth; a missing row means every default).
The page and its actions act only on the session user's own row — no teacher gate,
no bearer route.

- **Quiz results**: the switch "Save my quiz results for my personal statistics"
  (`save_quiz_results`, the Finish page's "Always") with the same privacy notice,
  the number of saved results, and "Delete my saved results", confirmed first.
  Deleting results never revokes an earned badge.
- **Actions** (`lib/user-settings-actions.ts`): `updateUserSettings` validates a
  strict schema (unknown fields reject the call) and upserts;
  `deleteMyQuizResults` deletes the user's rows.

## Error handling

The stores return `undefined` (or `false`) on a database error and never throw.
They never pass the raw error on: a Drizzle error's message embeds the SQL
parameters (user ids, counts), so `reportStoreFailure` logs and records a fixed
`Error("<store>: <op> failed")` plus the SQLSTATE (`sqlState()`) only.

## Tests

- Pure: `lib/achievements/*.unit.test.ts` (DST, New-Year weeks, school hours,
  local midnight, streaks, exact scores, medals, nudges, Refreshed across a pruned
  gap, every rule at/below/above its threshold, evaluation, XP boundaries, the
  catalog guard; the teacher window, attention rules, ranking and every teacher
  rule; the two catalogs' ids never colliding).
- Cache: `lib/home-cache.unit.test.ts`. Stores and actions:
  `lib/achievement-store.unit.test.ts`, `lib/quiz-result-store.unit.test.ts`
  (transaction shape, fixed failure messages), `lib/achievement-actions.unit.test.ts`,
  `lib/user-settings-actions.unit.test.ts`, `saveQuizResult` in
  `lib/quiz-actions.unit.test.ts`, the guard `lib/quiz-result-isolation.unit.test.ts`.
  `lib/teacher-facts-store.unit.test.ts` (every statement keyed by the teacher,
  groups failing alone, fixed failure messages, the reports and files statements'
  shapes). Loader: `lib/home-data.unit.test.ts` (both view models with their
  badges, new grants inserted before building for both audiences, a failed group
  never read as 0, the cache keys).
- Sections: `app/_home/sections.unit.test.tsx`, `app/_home/teacher-sections.unit.test.tsx`;
  shell: `app/page.unit.test.tsx` (student, teacher, view-as-student, signed out;
  the shared strip and Badges given the teacher audience only on the teacher shell).
- Browser: `app/_home/*.browser.test.tsx` (calendar keyboard/tooltip/phone layout,
  the seen marker, the disclosures, the attention counters, the school-hours
  tooltip, every badge family's disc colour and glyph contrast), `app/[code]/_quiz/save-result.browser.test.tsx`
  (the three choices, the automatic save), `app/settings/*.browser.test.tsx`.
- E2E: `e2e/home.spec.ts` (hermetic smoke per visitor kind — the teacher gets the
  dashboard, view-as-student the student page — including a fresh student's and a
  fresh teacher's empty state with the badges to earn), `e2e/home-teacher.live.spec.ts`
  (`@live-db`: a seeded teacher's counters, KPIs and ranking with another
  teacher's rows never counted; the SQL school-hours cut against `isSchoolHour`
  across both clock changes; the teacher statements' plans; badges granted from
  seeded rows with their dates, the strip cleared once seen, nothing granted
  twice) and `e2e/home.live.spec.ts` (`@live-db`: seeded usage and
  grant, the strip cleared after the visit, DST grouping, both plans; seeded coding
  requests and a key earning the Coding badges and In the Zone), `e2e/settings.spec.ts`
  (`@live-db`: reached from the user menu, the switch persists) and
  `e2e/quiz-results.live.spec.ts` (`@live-db`: the prune under two concurrent saves,
  a save racing a code delete, `always` rolling back, an automatic save racing the
  switch-off, seeded results on the start page and deleted from Settings, a code
  delete dropping results, both new plans). The Finish page's choices need a graded
  answer, i.e. an LLM, so they are covered by the component tests.
