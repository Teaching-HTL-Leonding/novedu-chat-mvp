A quiz is an activity made of open-ended questions. There are deliberately no multiple-choice options: students answer in their own words, and the AI grades each answer against guidance you write. Every answer gets a verdict (correct, partially correct, or incorrect) plus written feedback the student sees straight away.

Because the grading is a prompt you write in plain language, a question can ask for anything the AI can judge from your guidance: a fact, an explanation, a short calculation, or a piece of reasoning. You don't need to be a programmer to build one.

## What students experience

Students open a quiz and see a welcome screen with a greeting and a short description you write. Then the questions come one at a time; by default their order is shuffled for each attempt, though you can keep your authored order when later questions build on earlier ones.

For each question, a student reads it, types an answer in their own words, and submits. The AI grades the answer and immediately shows a verdict, correct, partial, or incorrect, together with feedback that confirms or gently corrects them. After seeing the feedback, the student can open a short discussion chat about that question to ask why an answer was wrong or to dig into the idea behind it.

If you allow it, students can also attach a photo of their work, for example a handwritten calculation, and the AI grades the photo together with (or instead of) the typed text. Photo answers are off by default.

## How you shape a quiz

For each question you write two separate things:

- **The question** students see on screen, worded however you like.
- **A grading guide** for the AI, which students never see. Here you can state the expected answer openly and describe what counts as correct, partially correct, and incorrect.

Because the grading guide stays private, you can be completely explicit in it: name the right answer, list acceptable variations, and say what the feedback should sound like. The AI maps each student answer onto your criteria and writes the feedback from them. If the grading feels too strict or too lenient, you reword the guide and the next answers are graded your way.

You can also add guidance for the follow-up discussion chat, for example a rule that it should hint rather than repeat the full solution.

By default, quizzes are anonymous: answers feed the aggregate statistics, but the app doesn't record which student gave which answer. You can change that when you want attributed, graded work; the sharing chapters cover the details.

## When a quiz is the right choice

Pick a quiz when you want to check understanding and give every student individual feedback: after introducing a topic, as a self-check before a test, or as a warm-up that shows you where the class stands. Each student answers set questions and learns immediately what was right, what was missing, and why.

A quiz follows a fixed set of questions rather than an open conversation. When students need free-form help on a topic, build a tutor instead. When they should produce a longer text of their own with AI feedback beside them, build a writing activity.
