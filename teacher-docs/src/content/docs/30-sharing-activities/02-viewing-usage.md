Novedu gives you two views on how your activities are being used: each code has its own statistics page, and a separate usage view sums up all AI use across the school. Both are visible to teachers only.

## What counts as a use

A use is counted when a student actually writes something: sends a chat message, submits a quiz answer, or works on a text. A student who merely opens the page and leaves without typing doesn't count. So the numbers tell you who worked, not who clicked.

## A code's statistics page

The **Codes** list shows a quick interaction count next to every code. Select the stats icon on a row to open that code's own page. What it shows depends on the module:

- **Tutor and quiz codes** show the number of conversations (for a quiz, discussions), and a table of each one with its first and last message time and how many messages the student wrote. Each row opens the full conversation as a read-only transcript.
- **Writing codes** show who saved a text: each student's name, when they last saved, and how many feedback conversations they had. Opening a student takes you to their saved text and their conversations, with previous and next buttons to read through the whole class.
- **Coding codes** show the connection details and configuration; there are no in-app conversations to list.

For a per-user code you also see how many distinct students took part, and each conversation carries the student's name.

An anonymous code shows the same counts and the same conversations, but no student identities: no names, no per-student view. Anonymity hides *who* wrote something, never *what* was written, so you can still read the transcripts.

## The overall usage view

Select **Usage** in the menu to see how much AI the whole installation has used. A time filter (**Last 24 hours**, **7 days**, **30 days**, or **365 days**) applies to everything on the page:

- **Token usage over time**: a bar chart of how much the AI models processed per hour, day, or month, with the same numbers in a table below it.
- **Three breakdowns**: tokens by category (tutor, quiz, writing, coding), by code (labelled with the note you gave each code), and by model.
- **Two totals**: **Chats** (conversations where a student wrote at least one message) and **Quiz answers graded**.

All times on the usage view are UTC, so during the school year the labels sit one or two hours behind Austrian clock time.

The usage view never shows student names or message content; it is about volume, not people. To read what was said under a specific code, use that code's own statistics page.
