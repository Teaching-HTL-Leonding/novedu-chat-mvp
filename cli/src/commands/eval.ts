// `novedu-cli eval <evalPathOrUrl...>` — run an eval file against the real activity path
// and report what the model actually did (docs/cli-eval.md). Two kinds, inferred from
// each file's own `kind` (there is no flag, and a batch may MIX them):
//
//   quiz  — replay GOLDEN ANSWERS through the real grader (`POST /api/eval/grade`).
//   tutor — generate the next tutor turn of each scripted CONVERSATION
//           (`POST /api/eval/respond`) and let the judge check it.
//
// The split is deliberate: the CLI assembles every prompt OFFLINE (through the app's own
// `dumpPrompts` seam, so unpushed local YAML works), and the server handles ONE case per
// request on the exact production path. The fan-out, the retries, the majority vote and
// the whole report live here; the endpoints stay stateless.
//
// The JUDGE (on by default, `--no-judge-feedback` to skip) rides the same shape for both
// kinds: one `POST /api/eval/judge` per successful repeat, auditing that repeat's own
// output for compliance with the very system prompt it ran under. It REPORTS and never
// gates — a flag changes no exit code, for either kind.
//
// `eval` is a strict-mode reserved identifier, so every binding here is named
// `registerEval` / `runEvalCommand` / `evalFile` — never `eval`.
